Some of the code has been done with based on several examples found on the web, however the ideas and code adaptation 
has been done all by me:

* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6210757/java-lang-classnotfoundexception-org-springframework-web-context-contextloaderl

are located in the "resources" folder.

* Spring version:     4.1.6
* Hibernate version:  4.3.8
* Apache CXF version: 2.7.12
